I'm a software engineer with a strong backend and automation background, currently working in DevOps and platform environments. I enjoy building complex systems and turning ideas into reliable, well-structured solutions.

Beyond my day-to-day work, I'm especially interested in educational technology, with a focus on language learning. Over time, this interest has led me to explore applied linguistics, text simplification, and natural language processing as foundations for building more effective learning tools.

I'm currently deepening my studies in AI, linguistics and related fields, with the goal of pursuing an international master's program and working on research-driven projects that have a real impact on learners and educators.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🔗 [LexiGrade — CEFR-aligned Text Simplification for Language Learning](https://github.com/Lexi-Grade/lexigrade-app)

LexiGrade is a research-oriented system designed to simplify texts according to CEFR levels while preserving their original meaning, supporting both language learners and educators.

The system combines large language models with explicit linguistic constraints, automatic evaluation, semantic preservation assessment and controlled regeneration strategies. LLMs play a central role in generation and semantic preservation, but are always embedded within a structured pipeline that emphasizes reproducibility, evaluation, and pedagogical validity.

LexiGrade explores the intersection of applied linguistics, NLP, and AI-assisted education, with a strong focus on text simplification, language acquisition, and CEFR alignment. The project also serves as the basis for ongoing academic work, with a scientific article currently under review.

**Focus areas:** Applied Linguistics · Language Learning · NLP · LLM-based Systems · Evaluation · EdTech

> *More coming soon, with a focus on AI-assisted educational systems and language-related applications.*
